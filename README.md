# Blacklist_mod
-Ingame customization will follow-

This mod has 4 modes so far. You can switch with "Alt + o" between them.

[1] The mod is disabled.

[2] The mod adds all arties to your blacklist, if you press "Alt + b". Also the arty that hits you will be added automatically (except friends and platoon mates).

[3] Every player who is hitting you with HE will be added.

[4] This mode includes mode [3] and if you press "Alt + b", all players will be added to your blacklist (except friends and platoon mates).

If your blacklist is full, you can easily extend it with pressing "Ctrl + o" (restarting the game is required).

You now can clear your blacklist. Pressing "Alt + c" enables/stops clearing. 

"Alt + x" starts clearing. This may take some time. Make sure you are in the garage.

If you want to edit the modes, edit the json file.
